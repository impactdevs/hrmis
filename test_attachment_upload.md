# Attachment Upload Fix Verification

## Issue Fixed
The main issue was that the appraisal form was missing `enctype="multipart/form-data"` attribute, which is required for file uploads.

## Changes Made

1. **Fixed form enctype** in `resources/views/appraisals/edit.blade.php`:
   - Added `enctype="multipart/form-data"` to the form tag (line 103)

2. **Fixed field name inconsistency** in `app/Http/Controllers/AppraisalsController.php`:
   - Updated `getAttachmentData` method to use `relevant_documents` instead of `documents` (line 706)
   - Added fallback to use `title` field if `name` is not available (line 708)

## Files Involved

- **Form**: `resources/views/appraisals/edit.blade.php` (line 103)
- **Controller**: `app/Http/Controllers/AppraisalsController.php` (lines 706-708)
- **Model**: `app/Models/Appraisal.php` (already had correct casting for both fields)

## How to Test

1. **Log into the system** as a staff member
2. **Create a new appraisal** or edit an existing one
3. **Go to the attachments section** (Section 5 at the bottom)
4. **Click "Add Attach Any Relevant Documents"**
5. **Upload a file** (PDF, DOC, or image)
6. **Fill in a title** for the document
7. **Save as draft** or **submit** the form
8. **Verify the file appears** in the attachment list with proper icons
9. **Test the view/download buttons** work correctly

## Expected Behavior

- **Before fix**: Files were not being saved to the database, view/download buttons didn't work
- **After fix**: Files should be properly uploaded, saved to storage, and the view/download functionality should work

## Technical Details

- Files are stored in `storage/app/public/proof_documents/`
- Database stores file paths in `appraisals.relevant_documents` JSON column
- File paths are relative (e.g., `proof_documents/filename.pdf`)
- The controller handles multiple possible storage paths for backwards compatibility

## Routes Available

- View attachment: `/appraisals/{appraisal}/attachment/{index}/view`
- Download attachment: `/appraisals/{appraisal}/attachment/{index}/download`
- Download all attachments: `/appraisals/{appraisal}/attachments/download-all`
